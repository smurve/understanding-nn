# Current Understanding of Neural Networks

I read a lot about neural networks, which has become quite an addiction. But I'm just a physicist gone astray.
So the notebooks in here represent my current idea of what is published about the inner workings of neural networks.

By no means is the content verified, scientifically sound or comprehensive. 

But still, I believe it's a pretty cool collection of things around neural networks that you may find at least inspiring...

To get going, install virtualenv, some python3, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow 1.7
